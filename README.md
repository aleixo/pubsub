# Publish subscribe pattern

This repo was build during one meetup about the pattern. 
It has one NodeJs App that instanciates several clients on the router ('/:group_name') call.

The clients communicate with one publish subscribe mechanism. 

All This one is done only in brevety in mind (2 hours +/-). No JSDocs nor unit tests. 

## TODO

I will try to convince people to elaborate on this.
